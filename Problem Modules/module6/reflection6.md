# Reflection module 6

## I. WEEKLY MEETING AND FOLLOW-UP LECTURE

### a) Did you have your compulsory weekly meeting with a supervisor?

Yes, we had a productive discussion about defining an equilibrium and analyzing its stability.

### b) Did both of you attend the compulsory follow-up lecture? If you already talked to us about this, please explain.

We attended the follow-up lecture.

### c) If you were asked to talk to a supervisor about the main submission, who did you talk to?

We were not asked to talk to a supervisor.

## II. WHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE AND LEARN?

In the first problem, we learned how to analyze equations trying to make sense of the constants and what the equations represents, without knowing much about the problem. We then learned how to determine equilibriums in a system of equations and discuss what these meant and how they could be justified based of real-world logic. We learned how to do this visually with drawings in a graph. This helped us analyzing equilibriums and their stability. For this problem we also applied our knowledge in extending models that we have acquired in past modules.

The signal processing problem we learned how to analyze graphs and compare input with output and see how a signal processing component works. We gained knowledge about how sound works, which helped us draw qualitative conclusions about the usage of the signal processing component. We also learned to discuss how it would sound speaking into the equation by analyzing our conclusions from previous parts of the problem. We got better at using tools in mathematica to analyze and arrive at our conclusions. Throughout the problem we applied our iterative process skills by breaking down the problem into subproblems.

In the drug dosage problem, we learned to define parts of the problem ourselves with the information given. We had to define the scope and then start small, trying to mathematically with simple equations decide the dosage and interval time. Discussing this we discovered flaws in the model. This led us to find a more creative approach by simulating a patient with the drug by an algorithm in java. The algorithm analyzes where the drug dose interval stabilizes over time which gave us an answer for dosage and interval applicable to any drug in the scope we defined. 

In the last problem we put ourselves in the shoes of a supervisor. This challanged our creative minds as we learned more how similar modelling approaches could be applied to very different problems. We also experienced how one can find a qualitative model for a problem without having problem-specific knowledge. Knowing this, we carefully found well formulated questions to get the recipient's mind going.

## III. (HOW WELL DID YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEMS?)

In this module we tried to have a methodical approach to all problems. We encountered difficulties along the way but used our acquired skills in modelling to find creative solutions. Looking back at our methods and solutions, we believe that we found very good solutions to all problems.

Self-Assessment: Very Good
