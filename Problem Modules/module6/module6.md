## 1. Whales and Krill Problem

## 2. Signal Processing Problem

## 3. Drug Dosage Problem

## 4. Socratic Questioning
### a) 
 - *Question:* Have you done a plot of the data points in a graph?
  
 - *Question:* What can we say about the data points? Are they linnear or not?
 - *Question:* Can you guess the form of the function? *Discussion errupts*.
 - *Question:* Based on the form you guessed, can you use the values in the table to deffine the function more precisely to fit the data? Can it be justified?
  



### b)
 - *Question:* Have you plotted the function in combination with points? How well does your function fit with all the points?


 - *Qusetion:* What are your functions edge cases? Like when x goes to zero or infinity. Is it reasonable that the data should behave similarly for the problem?
 - *Question:* What other form of functions follows a similar pattern, try plotting!

### c)
- *Question:* What do we know? We start listing the values we know from the question.
  
- *Question:* Is there a relation between these values? Have you tried plotting them?
- *Question:* How do we know that the machine is worth buying? How do we know it's a good investment?
- *Question:* Is there anything else they can do to increase sales? What does the data say?

### d)
- *Question:* What do you think the question is asking for? (This starts a discussion where the group starts talking about the problem, which can lead to them understanding it more without a supervisor telling them anything. A classic *rubber duck* situation).
  
- *Question:* What part of the question are you having trouble with? (We can try to formulate it in another way)
- *Question:* Can we break it down to smaller parts?
- *Situation:* If they give suggestions that are not relevant, try to ask questions that disproves it. If they are on the right track, just let them continue and ask if they feel like they can move on.
