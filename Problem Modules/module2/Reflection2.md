# Reflection module 1

## I. WEEKLY MEETING AND FOLLOW-UP LECTURE

### a) Did you have your compulsory weekly meeting with a supervisor?

Yes, we had a meeting with Robin Adams where we talked about the module and discussed the bridge problem. The discussion was about how the drivers know which route is faster. The answer was that "the word gets around". We also talked about the meaning of an equilibrium.

### b) Did both of you attend the compulsory follow-up lecture? If you already talked to us about this, please explain.

Both of us attended the follow-up lecture

### c) If you were asked to talk to a supervisor about the main submission, who did you talk to?

We were not asked to talk to a supervisor.

## II. WHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE AND LEARN?

From the chocolate factory problem, we learned how to sort out data and use what was necessary to draw a qualitative conclusion. We quickly realized that we had to find a good solution rather than finding the exact solution as we were given very little information. From the follow up lecture we also learnt that it was possible to model the optimal unit price in order to maximize the quanity with a function and thereby revenue. We chose to pick the the unit price from the table that showed the best revenue from the hometown.

In the emergency care problem, we learned how to correctly set up variables. We first made a mistake modeling the travel time before we realized that the only thing we had to consider was weather it was within eight minutes or not. We only needed the sites as variables and subject it to the right constraints. Another thing we learned was how to use mathematica to model and optimize linear programming problems.

To solve the communications problem, we used many of the things we learned from the previous task. We knew directly that we first had to set up the right variables without thinking about what the solution was going to be. We also imroved our skills sketching the problem and going to discussion to a finished formula in mathematica.

In the shortest path problem, we learned how to model a problem that we have seen many times in the IT-program as a linear programming problem. Yet again we used the knowledge of defining the variables correctly in order to model an objective function that we really could understand. It is possible that we overdid the problem and answered more than the question asked for, but this led to a bigger understanding of linear programing problems and of the shortest path problem.

Approaching the bridge problem, we thought first of how we could model this problem as linear programming. We used a sketch to understand what variables to use and finding an objective function with the right constraints. We learnt to change our own reasoning of a "real" problem by analyzing our solution. First, we were confident that the travel time had to be reduced by adding the bridge. Our model taught us that it was the direct opposite.

## III. (HOW WELL DID YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEMS?)

We believed we solved all but the first problem very good. We used well thought through models and applied our knowledge methodically to each task.

We spent a lot of time on this module and we can really see a diffrence from the first module. This time we really understood and used the proper modeling techniques that we are taught in this course.

Assessment: Good

We are proud and think that we solved all the problems except the first one with "very good" standards. However, the first question has more room for interpretation than the rest, so we feel rather good about that solution as well.
