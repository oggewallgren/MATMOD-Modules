# Reflection module 1

## I. WEEKLY MEETING AND FOLLOW-UP LECTURE

### a) Did you have your compulsory weekly meeting with a supervisor?

Yes, we discussed the module with Robin Adams and refined our answer on the first problem in this module. We also changed how we phrased one part of the project planning problem when we explained how we used the shortest path as a linear model.

### b) Did both of you attend the compulsory follow-up lecture? If you already talked to us about this, please explain.

We attended the follow-up lecture.

### c) If you were asked to talk to a supervisor about the main submission, who did you talk to?

We were not asked to talk to a supervisor.

## II. WHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE AND LEARN?

We improved our skills reasoning and discussing real life situations and model them in terms of discreet data structures.

In the project planning problem, we also learnt how to model a real life scenario in terms of discrete data structures. After modeling the problem with a directed graph, we improved our skills in using a solution to a diffrent problem to find a solution to our problem. We used the shortest path solver to find the longest path by negating the values, which gave us the answer to the question. We improved these skills by remodelling inorder to take uncertainty (when time to complete a task is uncertain) into account.

For the conference problem we used the same idea we learned in the project planning problen and again used the shortest path to find the longest path. This could be used when we represented each lecture with a node and connected possible ways to walk between them with an edge valued $1$. Finding the longest path between these yielded the maximum number of lectures. We also found it reasonable to use _set packing_ because it defines objects that are not possible to combine, in this case lectures overlapping.

In the subset_sum and partition problem we improved our skills breaking down the problem in smaller parts and started with small examples trying to find the solution. Trying a few different examples, we quickly found a model using the subset_sum to solve the partition problem. We were unable to solve the second part of the problem trying to model the partition solver to find a subset_sum.

## III. (HOW WELL DID YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEMS?)

Other than not being able to solve the second part of problem $4$ we believe we solved the problems very good. We used our modeling skills acquired so far in the course and found well developed models for each problem. We constantly tried to disprove out theories, making sure that our solutions could be justified by scenarios. We spent lots of time trying diffrent creative approaches to the problems, often arriving at more than one solution.

Assessment: very good.
