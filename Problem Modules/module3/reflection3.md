# Reflection module 1

## I. WEEKLY MEETING AND FOLLOW-UP LECTURE

### a) Did you have your compulsory weekly meeting with a supervisor?

Yes we discussed the module with Robin Adams and refined our answer on the first problem in this module. We also changed how we phrased one part of the project planning problem when we explained how we used the shortest path as a linear model.

### b) Did both of you attend the compulsory follow-up lecture? If you already talked to us about this, please explain.

We attended the follow-up lecture.

### c) If you were asked to talk to a supervisor about the main submission, who did you talk to?

We were not asked to talk to a supervisor.

## II. WHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE AND LEARN?

We improved our skills reasoning and discussing real life situations and model them in terms of discreet data structures.

In the project planning problem we also learnt how to model a real life scenario in terms of discrete data structures. After modeling the problem with a directed graph, we improved our skills in using a solution to a diffrent problem to find a solution to our problem. We used the shortest path solver to find the longest path by negating the values, which gave us the answer to the question. We improved these skills by remodelling inorder to take uncertainty into account.

## III. (HOW WELL DID YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEMS?)

We believed we solved all but the first problem very good. We used well thought through models and applied our knowledge methodically to each task.

We spent a lot of time on this module and we can really see a diffrence from the first module. This time we really understood and used the proper modeling techniques that we are taught in this course.

Assessment: Good

We are proud and think that we solved all the problems except the first one with "very good" standards. However, the first question has more room for interpretation than the rest, so we feel rather good about that solution as well.
